_Learn how to use Python dictionaries to store and retrieve data_

# Python dictionaries course

Although dictionaries look complex with different ways to represent, retrieve, and store data, they can be straightforward to use. In this course I'll show you how to store, retrieve, and loop over dictionaries. Once you go through these different actions, you should be able to choose the right approach to work effectively with dictionaries.
